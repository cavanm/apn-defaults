APN Defaults
============

Project is for building and using a public source of MMSC APN data for use when access to the device APN data is not available. For instance when developing MMS apps for Android 4.2, 4.3. The class provides an in-app source for APN MMSC info for use as a fallback in the event that the system APN DB is unavailable and the user has not provided local MMSC configuration details of their own. 

It also provides a way for working APN configurations to report their parameters to a central source so that the data can be integrated into this class and shared with the public.
